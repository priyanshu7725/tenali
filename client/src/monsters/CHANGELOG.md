## v0.0.1 — 2026-07-09 (branch creation, scaffolding)

**Session:** Branch cut from `upstream/main`. No code yet.

**Branch:** `feature/monster-misconceptions` (off commit `93f0cea` at branch time).

**Decisions baked into the branch baseline (from spec v0.2):**
- Storage: `localStorage` key `tenali.monsterLog.v1`. Zero new server endpoints.
- Hook: `window.fetch` monkey-patch, dispatch `tenali:wrongAnswer` CustomEvent.
- Carry Crasher: `enabled: false` by default. Test before turning on.
- Hall placement: C-only for v1 (toast→Hall). Code is placement-agnostic.
- Cure: 4/5 correct threshold. History stays on cure. No respawn.
- Toast variants: "introduced!" (5s) vs "strikes again!" (2s) based on `seenMonsterIds`.

**Carry-overs from spec discussion:**
- Friend's AF (Daily Streak Tracker) is out of scope — no cross-feature reads.
- Friend should be told about Carry Crasher gating pattern if he hits similar fragile heuristics.
- Spec is mutable — changes during build get patched in-place in `FEATURE_MONSTERS.md` and noted here.

**Implementation order (from spec §10):**
1. `monsterExplanations.js`
2. `monsterStore.js`
3. `classifier.js`
4. `fetchInterceptor.js`
5. `MonsterToast.jsx` + App.jsx mount
6. `HallPanel.jsx` + `MonsterCard.jsx` + `MonsterDetail.jsx` + App.jsx mount
7. `CureFlow.jsx`
8. End-to-end test
9. Demo (live to maintainer on `quadratic` topic)

**Files touched in this commit:**
- `client/src/monsters/CHANGELOG.md` (new)

**Verification:** branch only, no functional changes.
